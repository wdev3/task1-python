# Task Manager (Terminal)

Simple code made just for training purposes. The idea was to test how far I could apply what I learned in the first weeks studying Python.

## About

This project was created with no intention of being professional.

It is not something to be taken seriously, it was just a personal learning exercise.

The code will not be updated or improved; it is exactly as it was made at the time of learning.

## Features

- Add tasks with name, description, and difficulty.
- Save everything in a .txt file.
- Built only with basic concepts: variables, lists, functions, classes, conditionals, loops, and file handling.

## Disclaimer

This code has no advanced error handling or professional code organization. It is 100% an experiment from someone who is just starting (I'm in my second week learning Python).
